# sugar-vamp
Lecture User Interface Design: together in a group of four students we created a complete prototype of a diabetes app for children. Inside the app the child is able to communicate with a vampire character which shows and explains the kid how the app works. Therefore we use child-friendly gamification, affordable navigation and colorful visualization. The app allows to connect with a similar parent app which tracks the measured blood level of the kid and in critical situations contacts the doctor. Measured data is inserted by the kid on the app and is saved in a table. Another feature is that the child needs to make pictures of the daily food to track the sugar level. In addition there is a little game included.
